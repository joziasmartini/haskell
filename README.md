Studies in Haskell.

### Introduction

Haskell is a purely functional, general-purpose programming language named after the logician Haskell Curry. The language is based on the observations of Haskell Curry and his intellectual descendants.

It is the functional language on which most research is carried out today. Widely used in academia, it is a relatively new language, derived from other functional languages, such as Miranda and ML.

It is based on a programming style that emphasizes more what should be done (what) rather than how it should be done (how), with a focus on reaching solutions to mathematical problems with clarity and easy maintenance.

In Haskell there are only functions, and all functions are unary. What in other programming languages ​​would be binary, ternary functions, etc., in Haskell are functions whose return value are other functions.

### Setup

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- Install [Haskell Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=justusadam.language-haskell) plugin
- Install (if linux) Haskell Platform with `apt install haskell-platform`
- Install (if windows) [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

### Running

- Locate the file folder through terminal
- Run the code with `ghci filename.hs`
- Then, in terminal, execute the funcion with name and parameter
- For example, `multiply 3 6`
